# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    - I feel that I spend most time studying (and maybe even too much time). I'm still working on taking regular breaks and finding other activities. I realized sleep and a good eating schedule is important. My tip for my classmates would be to find what time works best for you, and either sleep early and wake up early to study, or sleep later to study and wake up later! 
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
    - A function is a package of instructions that need to be called to carry out those instructions. 
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    - Parameters are in function declarations whereas arguments reside in function calls. Parameters behave like variables whereas arguments behave like values. Also, the number and order of arguments passed matches the number and order of the parameter declared. 
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
    - Why do we need functions when we can type console.log each time?
    - What are ways that console.log differs from return?
